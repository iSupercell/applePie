# Apple Pie!
This is the very first project I made using jQuery! The main goal was to practice using jQuery to manipulate the HTML when users interacted with the app.

I tried to create something that mimics the in-game dialogue mechanism. Unfortunately, story writing is not my thing so this ended up being a simple multiplication game.

## How it works
1. User can navigate the game by clicking on the < and > arrows.
2. The text inside the dialogue box will change accordingly.
3. The user will be given a choice between YES or NO (spoiler alert: One can only proceed upon choosing YES).
4. The YES or NO option is disabled at other times to avoid confusion.
5. The Character's expression will change accordingly.
6. The numbers forming the math question in the dialogue text will be generated at random.
7. The generated numbers will appear in the equation visual below the dialogue box.
8. The user will be able to input and submit their answer.
9. The submitted answer will be checked (right vs. wrong). 
10. The character's expression and dialogue will be changed accordingly.
11. A reroll button will appear once user has answered correctly.
12. User can then choose to reroll for a new equation.

NOTE: The input and submit button are disabled until the equation is generated to avoid errors.
